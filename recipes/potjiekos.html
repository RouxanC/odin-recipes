    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A slow-cooked beef stew made in a cast iron pot and event to celebrate.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter x 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil x 4 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Minced garlic cloves x 2-3</li>
        <li>Chopped beef x 1kg</li>
        <li>Onions x 3</li>
        <li>Celery x 1 cup</li>
        <li>Diced bacon x 1 pack</li>
        <li>Ground thyme x 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Ground corrainder x 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Ground cumin x 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Chopped butternut x 3 cups</li>
        <li>Halved baby potatoes x 10</li>
        <li>Halved carrots x 2</li>
        <li>Large baby marrows x 2</li>
        <li>Tomato paste x 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Red wine x 2/3 cups</li>
        <li>Beef stock x 1 cup</li>
        <li>Passata x 1 cup</li>
        <li>Salt/Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the meat and mix to make sure it is well covered.</li>
        <li>Over hot coals, place the potjie pot (I used a size 2 potjie pot which served 5 of us easily plus leftovers) and add the oil and butter. Allow it to heat up until almost bubbling. Add the meat in 2 or 3 batches and brown it on all sides. Remove meat from the potjie and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, celery, garlic, bacon, coriander, cumin and thyme and allow to cook and soften for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove some coals now to reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the meat back to the pot, add the potatoes, carrots, baby marrows and butternut (or whatever vegetables you have chosen). No need to stir.</li>
        <li>Mix the tomato paste, red wine, beef stock and passata together in a jug and then add to the pot. Again, no need to stir through once the liquid is in the potjie pot.</li>
        <li>Grind a generous amount of salt and black pepper into the pot.</li>
        <li>Place the lid on and sit back and relax!</li>
        <li>Allow to simmer for 3 hours or longer, up to 4 or 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Check the potjie every 40 minutes or so to make sure it is not too hot - you want a gentle simmer and not a ferocious boil!</li>
        <li>You may want to stir the potjie after an hour or two to make sure the meat is not stuck to the bottom. Generally speaking, you want to avoid over-stirring.</li>
        <li>If you have too much liquid towards the end, just take the lid off and allow some liquid to burn off.</li>
        <li>Serve with rice (or other carbohydrates).</li>
    </ol>
